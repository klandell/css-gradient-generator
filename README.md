# CSS Gradient Generator
This is a css gradient generator written using React on the front end, and a very simple express server with websockets on the back end.
The gradient generator allows two color stops to be chosen. The color can be picked using a canvas color picker, by specifying an RGB value, or by specifying the color's hex code. The generator can produce linear and radial gradients, with an assortment of directions. If anyone else is currently using the css color generator, you will be able to see the colors that they are creating as well in the "Active Gradients" section.

A demo version of this app is available at https://css-gradient-generator.herokuapp.com. The app sleeps due to inactivity, so it may take a few moments for it to load the first time you access it.
